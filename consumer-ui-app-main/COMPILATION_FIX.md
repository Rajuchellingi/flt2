# Compilation Fix Applied

## Issue
```
The method 'debugPrint' isn't defined for the type 'MusicController'.
```

## Fix Applied âœ…

**File**: `lib/controller/background_music_controller.dart`

**Added import**:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';  // âœ… Added this line
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';
import 'package:get_storage/get_storage.dart';
```

The `debugPrint` function is part of Flutter's foundation library, which is now properly imported.
